## Thank you for taking the time to improve transparency around political donations!

If you wish to contribute open an issue first and start a discussion about the change you wish to make.
Once that has been agreed upon please open a draft pull request and then start your work.
As you commit your work please add comments to the draft PR explaining your code.
Even better would be to have docstrings and code comments that make it clear what you have done.
